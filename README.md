## Purpose

This fifth project of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND) instructed me to build adapt an existing restaurant reviews program to:
1. Display content if internet connection is lost (utilizing a service worker)
2. Be fully responsive on multiple screen sizes
3. Respect current standards in accessibility


## How_to_Run

To run the program locally on your computer (requires Internet connection, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, local server)
* Download the repository from GitHub
* Open the folder within your code editor of choice (I use Visual Studio Code)
* Initiate a live server with the appropriate extension (I use "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey)
* Or, create a local Python server


## Learning

* CSS: I thought I had a grasp on CSS before this project, but having to understand, unwind and improve on existing code pushed me to learn a lot more. Particular learning was the topic of positioning elements and proper use of padding.
* Accessibility: Utilizing a screen reader (Chrome Vox) helped me to understand how my content is experienced by the visually impaired. This also pushed me to go deeper in the concept of ARIA labeling.
* Service Worker: This aspect of the project took me the least time, compared to the other two, but was more challenging, as it was so abstract and feedback was hard to decipher. I could see immediately if my CSS or ARIA labels did not work, but it was much harder to determine why my files were not caching, or not loading.
